# PRD: epub3 - EPUB 3 Library

# Overview
epub3 is a software library designed to provide developers with a robust and easy-to-use interface for creating, parsing, manipulating, and validating EPUB 3 digital publications. It aims to encapsulate the complexities of the EPUB 3 specification ([https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub3/](https://www.w3.org/publishing/epub3/)), enabling developers to focus on building applications that leverage EPUB content without needing deep expertise in the underlying format details. This library is intended for developers building reading systems, content creation tools, digital library platforms, or any application requiring interaction with EPUB 3 files.

# Core Features
The library will provide the following core functionalities, adhering strictly to the EPUB 3.3 specification:

-   **EPUB Container Handling:**
    -   Read and parse the EPUB Open Container Format (OCF) ZIP structure.
    -   Create and write valid EPUB OCF ZIP containers.
    -   Access individual resources within the container.
-   **Package Document Parsing & Manipulation:**
    -   Parse the `.opf` Package Document, including metadata, manifest, spine, and bindings.
    -   Validate the Package Document structure and semantics against the specification.
    -   Programmatically access and modify metadata (including Dublin Core and meta properties).
    -   Programmatically access and modify the manifest (add, remove, update resources).
    -   Programmatically access and modify the spine (control reading order, linearity).
    -   Support for `collection` elements.
-   **Navigation Document Handling:**
    -   Parse EPUB Navigation Documents (XHTML format).
    -   Extract Table of Contents (`toc`), Landmarks (`landmarks`), and Page List (`page-list`).
    -   Create and modify Navigation Documents programmatically.
    -   Support for NCX for backward compatibility (reading only).
-   **Content Document Access:**
    -   Provide access to EPUB Content Documents (XHTML, SVG).
    -   Facilitate extraction of textual and multimedia content.
    -   Handle internal and external resource linking.
-   **Metadata Management:**
    -   Full support for required and optional EPUB 3 metadata elements (DC Terms, `meta` properties).
    -   Ability to add, remove, and update metadata entries.
    -   Support for link elements in metadata.
-   **Validation:**
    -   Integrate or provide mechanisms for validating EPUB files against the EPUB 3 specification (potentially leveraging tools like EPUBCheck).
    -   Provide detailed error reporting for validation failures.
-   **Creation API:**
    -   A high-level API to simplify the creation of new, valid EPUB 3 files from constituent parts (content files, metadata, navigation).

# Developer Experience
-   **API Design:** Provide a clean, intuitive, and well-documented API (e.g., Pythonic, idiomatic for the target language).
-   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling with informative messages for parsing, validation, and manipulation errors.
-   **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation including API reference, tutorials, and usage examples.
-   **Extensibility:** Design the library with potential extensibility in mind (e.g., custom metadata schemes, plugin architecture).

# Technical Architecture
-   **Language:** Python 3.x (Assumption, can be adapted)
-   **Core Modules:**
    -   `ocf`: Handles ZIP container reading/writing and structure.
    -   `package`: Parses, manipulates, and serializes the Package Document (`.opf`). Uses standard XML parsing libraries (e.g., `lxml`).
    -   `navigation`: Parses, manipulates, and serializes Navigation Documents (XHTML).
    -   `content`: Provides access to content documents and resources.
    -   `metadata`: Manages metadata elements.
    -   `validation`: Interface for EPUB validation logic.
    -   `factory`: High-level API for EPUB creation.
-   **Data Models:** Internal object representation of the EPUB structure (Container, Package, ManifestItem, SpineItem, NavPoint, etc.).
-   **Dependencies:** Standard XML/XHTML parsing library (e.g., `lxml`), ZIP library (e.g., `zipfile`). Optional dependency on EPUBCheck or similar validation tool.
-   **Testing:** Comprehensive unit and integration test suite covering parsing, manipulation, creation, and validation of various EPUB 3 features and edge cases.

# Development Roadmap
-   **MVP (Minimum Viable Product):**
    -   Parse valid EPUB 3 files (OCF, Package Document, Navigation Document - TOC only).
    -   Read access to metadata, manifest, spine, and basic content documents (XHTML).
    -   Ability to extract the Table of Contents.
    -   Basic validation checks for core structure.
    -   Ability to create a minimal, valid EPUB file with basic metadata, content, and TOC via the API.
-   **Phase 2:**
    -   Full read/write access to all Package Document sections (metadata, manifest, spine).
    -   Support for Landmarks and Page List in Navigation Documents.
    -   API for modifying existing EPUB structures (add/remove content, update metadata).
    -   More comprehensive validation, potentially integrating EPUBCheck results.
    -   Improved error reporting.
-   **Future Enhancements:**
    -   Support for Media Overlays (SMIL).
    -   Support for EPUB Scripting.
    -   Support for encryption and font obfuscation.
    -   Advanced validation features.
    -   Performance optimizations for large EPUB files.
    -   Support for EPUB CFI (Canonical Fragment Identifiers).
    -   Bindings/wrappers for other programming languages.

# Logical Dependency Chain
1.  **OCF Handling:** Foundational ability to read/write the ZIP container.
2.  **Package Document Parsing:** Read metadata, manifest, spine.
3.  **Navigation Document Parsing:** Read TOC, landmarks, page-list.
4.  **Content Access:** Ability to retrieve resources listed in the manifest.
5.  **Basic Validation:** Ensure core components exist and are parsable.
6.  **Data Model Modification:** APIs to change the internal representation.
7.  **Serialization:** Writing modified structures back to valid EPUB format (Package, Nav, OCF).
8.  **Creation API:** High-level interface building upon parsing, modification, and serialization.
9.  **Advanced Features:** Build upon the core structure (Media Overlays, Scripting, etc.).

# Risks and Mitigations
-   **Risk:** Complexity and nuances of the EPUB 3 specification.
    -   **Mitigation:** Rely heavily on the official W3C specifications. Implement extensive test suites using diverse and valid/invalid EPUB examples. Leverage EPUBCheck for validation reference.
-   **Risk:** Handling malformed or non-compliant EPUB files gracefully.
    -   **Mitigation:** Implement robust error handling and reporting. Clearly document limitations on handling non-standard files. Provide different parsing modes (strict vs. lenient) if feasible.
-   **Risk:** Performance bottlenecks with large EPUB files (many resources, large content documents).
    -   **Mitigation:** Profile and optimize parsing/serialization. Consider lazy loading for resources where appropriate. Use efficient XML parsing techniques.
-   **Risk:** Keeping up-to-date with potential EPUB specification revisions.
    -   **Mitigation:** Monitor W3C Publishing Working Group activities. Design for modularity to facilitate updates.
-   **Risk:** Ensuring cross-platform compatibility (if applicable beyond the primary language).
    -   **Mitigation:** Use standard libraries and avoid platform-specific features. Test on target platforms.
